/*! \class E3Track
  \brief Class describing a reconstructed track.

  A track is essentially the result of a point (the origin or the head of the
  track) and a direction, with additional related quantities such as the
  chisquare. The class provides a method to extrapolate the track to a plane
  orthogonal to the z-y plane.

  Note that, since we have no way to distinguish between upward-going and
  downward-going particles---and the vast majority of our tracks are
  downward-going, anyway---we generally impose that m_direction.z() < 0
  when reconstructing tracks. Nonetheless we measure the polar angle from the
  zenith angle (i.e. a track with theta = 0 is a vertical downward-going one).
